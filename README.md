## Summary

This project is a demonstration of an end-to-end data processing pipeline using databricks and the azure workflow. The pipeline involves ingesting raw data from a course, processing it and analyzing it (or extracting useful information) using an SQL query. 

The project is a good introduction to data pipelines and to azure's workflow feature. 

The following helpful [tutorial](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/data-pipeline-get-started.html) from databricks was used for this.

### The workflow:

The following screenshot shows the workflow:

Each of the step in the workflow is connected to the associated notebook from my workspace in azure. The following screenshot shows those notebooks:
